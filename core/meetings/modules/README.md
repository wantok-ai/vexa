# meetings/modules — the bricks

The meetings-domain bricks: one concern each, behind a contract, composed by
`meetings/services/`. A brick imports **contracts** and other bricks' **published
packages** (`@vexa/*`, never their `src/`) and third-party deps — never `services/`,
never another brick's internals (`gate:isolation`, P2). Services import bricks.

The transcript spine, in dependency order:

| Brick | Concern | In → out |
|---|---|---|
| [capture-codec](capture-codec/) | the shared capture/recording wire codec (pure) | — |
| [buffer](buffer/) | LocalAgreement-N confirmation core (pure) | — |
| [whisper](whisper/) | `stt.v1` egress (PCM → Whisper segments) | — |
| [soniox](soniox/) | Soniox WebSocket STT adapter (PCM → normalized segments) | — |
| _gmeet-capture_ | Google Meet per-channel audio + glow name | page → `gmeet-capture.v1` |
| [gmeet-pipeline](gmeet-pipeline/) | channel-routed transcription → transcript.v1 | `gmeet-capture.v1` → `transcript.v1` |

_Filled in brick-by-brick as each lands gate-green (Stage 3)._
