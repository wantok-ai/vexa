/**
 * Counting fixture — the DETERMINISTIC drop/mislabel detector for the gmeet lane under Google-Meet
 * CHANNEL-SWITCH behaviour. A meeting is simulated as a continuous count 1..N (the ground truth);
 * any number MISSING from the output is a DROPPED transcript, any number under the wrong speaker is a
 * MISLABEL, any out-of-order number is a segmentation fault. Counting is the perfect oracle: it is
 * monotonic, gapless, and every token is independently verifiable.
 *
 * Why this exists: real meetings drop lines at TURN BOUNDARIES — gmeet rotates a speaker onto a channel
 * mid-stream (glow change, no silence gap) or reuses a channel after a gap, and the lane closes/opens
 * turns there (gmeet-pipeline.ts closeTurn + LocalAgreement, which needs TWO agreeing passes to confirm).
 * The tail token of a turn is the one at risk. This fixture drives exactly those boundaries.
 *
 * Deterministic, OFFLINE, no model / no audio device: each number K is encoded as a constant PCM run
 * (sample = K/1000); a faithful mock-Whisper decodes the runs back to "K" with per-number timing — so
 * the REAL @vexa/gmeet-pipeline buffering / windowing / turn / confirm path runs, only the STT text is
 * substituted (same contract as pipeline-conformance.test.ts). This is the in-process twin of the
 * TTS→real-STT counting run (pipeline-realstt.live.test.ts territory); here it is reproducible in CI.
 *
