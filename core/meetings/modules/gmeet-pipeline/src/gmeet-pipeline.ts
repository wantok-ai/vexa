/**
 * gmeet-pipeline — Google Meet CHANNEL-routed strategy (overlap-safe).
 *
 *   capture.v1 (audio frames: CHANNEL index + glow NAME bound at the source)
 *        ──►  transcript.v1 (named segments + live drafts)
 *
 * The combination of main's overlap engine + glow naming. Google Meet delivers
 * each active speaker on a SEPARATE channel, so audio is routed by CHANNEL: two
 * speakers talking at once land on separate per-channel streams and are
 * transcribed INDEPENDENTLY — no muddling, onsets intact. The glow names each
 * channel-TURN, bound at the turn's ONSET (a single tile lit, before any overlap)
 * and HELD through the overlap (where per-frame glow would be ambiguous → UNKNOWN).
 *
 * Each (channel, turn) is its OWN SpeakerStreamManager stream with a name FIXED at
 * onset (`ch-<n>:<turn>`). A turn ends on a silence gap OR a confident glow-name
 * CHANGE (overlap rotates a channel mid-stream with no gap), opening a fresh turn —
 * so a stream's name never relabels mid-flight — no async flush/relabel race.
 *
 * CONTRACT BOUNDARY: identity is CARRIED (the glow bound it at capture), never
 * derived. No diarizer, no post-hoc window-match.
