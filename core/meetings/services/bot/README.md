# bot — the meetings ephemeral join+capture worker (Node/TS)

## Purpose

The disposable meeting-joining browser bot (P7 worker). It boots from a single `invocation.v1`
config in `VEXA_BOT_CONFIG`, joins a Google Meet / Zoom / Teams call over a humanized browser,
publishes a synthetic animated camera, captures audio, transcribes it (`@vexa/transcribe-soniox`,
with the explicit Whisper HTTP fallback), and publishes confirmed
`transcript.v1` segments + `lifecycle.v1` status — then dies. Node/TS because the join+capture
domain lives in the browser/Playwright ecosystem; it's a modular monolith behind ports — the
orchestrator core is offline-provable, while browser/redis/http are adapters wired only at the
composition root (`src/index.ts`).

## Seams

| Direction | Neighbour | Via | What crosses |
|---|---|---|---|
| consumes | scheduler / meeting-api (spawner) | `invocation.v1` in `VEXA_BOT_CONFIG` or `VEXA_BOT_CONFIG_FILE` | boot config: meeting URL, platform, ids, callback/upload URLs, secrets |
| spawns-over | `@vexa/join` + `@vexa/remote-browser` | in-process port (`JoinDriver`) | join/leave/removal over a humanized browser page |
| publishes | collector [Py] | redis stream `transcription_segments` (XADD) | `transcript.v1` durable segment feed |
| publishes | gateway → dashboard | redis pub/sub `tc:meeting:{id}:mutable` | live mutable `transcript.v1` segment |
| produces | meeting-api | HTTP POST → `inv.meetingApiCallbackUrl` | `lifecycle.v1` status events (retry/backoff) |
| produces | meeting-api | HTTP POST → `inv.recordingUploadUrl` | assembled recording master (multipart) |
| consumes | gateway (commands) | redis pub/sub `bot_commands:meeting:{id}` | `acts.v1` commands (e.g. `speak`, `speak_stop`, safe camera scene updates) |

### Pre-join reachability gate (#530)

Before any meeting navigation, the orchestrator makes the FIRST `joining` emit **load-bearing**
(`orchestrator.ts` → `emitJoining`): the HTTP sink's `emitReachable` reports whether the meeting-api
callback answered at all (any HTTP status = reachable; only an all-attempts network failure — the
fresh-node CNI-lag signature — is `unreachable`). Reachable ⇒ the join proceeds with **zero added
latency** (the secondary channel is never probed). Unreachable ⇒ it probes the secondary channel
(redis PING); **either channel up ⇒ proceed** (the bot can still report), **both down ⇒ refuse to
join** and terminate fast with a typed, attributed outcome instead of an opaque crashloop.

**Exit codes** (the terminal signal on k8s, where each bot is a bare Pod, `--restart=Never`):

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | clean terminal (`completed`, or a user `stop` withdraw) |
| `1` | join / runtime failure (`join_failure`, `validation_error`, admission rejected/timeout) |
| `3` | **control plane unreachable** — both the meeting-api callback and redis were unreachable at boot; the bot refused to join (`failed`, `failure_stage: requested`, `infra_fault: control_plane_unreachable`). Distinguishes a **broken node** from a **broken join** in one `kubectl describe`. |

## Contracts

**Owns:** none — the bot is a worker that implements published meetings contracts.
**Consumes:** [`invocation.v1`](../../contracts/invocation.v1) (boot config),
[`acts.v1`](../../contracts/acts.v1) (inbound commands),
[`lifecycle.v1`](../../contracts/lifecycle.v1) (status it produces),
[`transcript.v1`](../../contracts/transcript.v1) (segments it publishes). All four are TS-mirrored
in `src/contracts.ts` and validated against the sealed registry goldens (`contracts.seal.json`).

## Isolated evaluation

Unit/integration: `pnpm test` (chained `tsx` runs — no build step). Levels:
**L1** config ajv goldens · **L2** orchestrator `lifecycle.v1` state machine (fake ports) — incl. the
#530 reachability gate (both-channels-down ⇒ no join, exit 3, `control_plane_unreachable`; either-channel
up ⇒ proceed) · **L3** transport adapters (lifecycle-http `emitReachable` reachability verdict ·
transcript-redis · acts-redis), pipeline lane, recording
assembler, replay tape. **L4** (browser/capture/speak/upload legs) runs via the standalone harness in
[`eval/`](./eval): `make -C eval run MEETING=<id>` drives a live Meet with synthetic speakers and an
autonomous PASS/FAIL verdict (`make -C eval verify` for the offline oracle self-test).

## Status

- ✅ delivered — `invocation.v1` boot config (parse + ajv-validate, fail-fast)
- ✅ delivered — orchestrator `lifecycle.v1` state machine (joining → admission → active → completed/failed)
- ✅ delivered — `transcript.v1` egress (redis stream + mutable pub/sub)
- ✅ delivered — `lifecycle.v1` HTTP callback (retry/backoff, never crashes the bot)
- ✅ delivered — `acts.v1` ingress (redis subscriber; unknown acts dropped, never thrown)
- ✅ delivered — crop-safe 1280×720 synthetic camera with a text-optimized WebRTC profile, outbound resolution telemetry, an animated default signal, and command-driven task/decision scenes
- ✅ delivered — automatic barge-in: sustained remote speech cancels the active TTS request/playback and returns the public microphone to mute
- ✅ delivered — recording assembler core (webm/wav/seq, L2/L3)
- 🟡 partial — browser join + capture + recording-upload + speak (wired; L4-gated, proven on VM via `eval/`, not unit tests)
